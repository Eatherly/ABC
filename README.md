# ABC
- I can add/remove products to my virtual shopping cart in any quantities
- I can see my current cart status
- I have to choose a shipping option between 'pick up' (USD 0) and 'UPS' (USD 5). No option is chosen by default, so if i don't choose one and click on “Pay”, the interface asks me to select one. 
- After clicking on 'pay' (Originally my balance is USD 100 and after the purchase the remaining balance is stored) I want to see the previous balance, total purchase cost and my remaining balance after paying. 
- Near each product there is a rating scale from 1 to 5, I can rate it and I can see current average rating of each product. Rates are updated after each visit and they are stored using Mysql DB.
